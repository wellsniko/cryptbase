# Cryptbase

Cryptbase is a clone of Coinbase, a web app that allows users to buy, sell, and manage a cryptocurrency portfolio. It was built with Ruby on Rails and Postgres on the backend, and a frontend of React and Redux.

This is my first Full Stack Project, and the initial work was done in a 10 day period, with plans to be improved upon in the coming months.

### Features

* Encrypted user authentication in frontend and backend.
* Users can sign up, log in, or select a demo login to be automatically directed to the demo user's dashboard.
* New User's are initialized with $100,000 USD to purchase currencies.
* Users can see a list of the top 30 cryptocurrencies and their current prices before logging in.
* After logging in, users are directed to their dashboard, which displays their portolio and ownership of each currency, and details on their past orders.
* Logged in users can see a more detailed cryptocurrency index page with links to a detail page for each coin.
* Detail page for each currency displays a price chart, more details on the currency, and a buy box to purchase or sell the currency with the User's USD.
* Buy Box is fully functioning with error messages for invalid purchases and alerts for successful purchases.4
